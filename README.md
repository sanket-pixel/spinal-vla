# spinal-vla
A real-time "spinal" controller for deploying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, decoupling 100Hz motor reflexes from slow AI inference. Leverages the DLA (Deep Learning Accelerator) for low-latency safety policies and Isaac Sim for high-fidelity Sim-to-Real validation.
